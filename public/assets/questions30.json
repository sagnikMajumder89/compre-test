    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "The Bell-LaPadula model is a confidentiality model that implements multi-lateral security by using security levels and compartments (categories) to control access. [cite: 477, 483]"

      "Complex security condition",
      "*-Property",
      "Multi lateral security"

  {
    "question": "In the Biba Model, a subject can only read an object o if:",
    "options": ["Is > Io", "LO > LS", "Is <= Io", "LO > LS"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "This refers to the Simple Integrity Axiom of the Biba model, also known as the 'no read down' rule, which states a subject's integrity level (Is) must be less than or equal to the object's integrity level (Io) to read it. [cite: 514]"

      "None"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "Big O notation is primarily used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's complexity, which corresponds to its worst-case performance scenario. [cite: 529, 531, 532]"
