    "question": "Which of the following is a property of peer-to-peer systems?",
    "options": [
      "Clients and servers are not distinguished from one another",
      "Separate machines act as either the client or the server but not both.",
      "They do not offer any advantages over traditional client-server systems",
      "They suffer from the server acting as the bottleneck in performance"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "In a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, each node, or peer, can function as both a client and a server, sharing and requesting resources directly from other peers. [cite: 1]"

      "They are used to manage interrupts"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "A program in user mode can attempt to execute a privileged instruction. [cite: 1] This attempt will cause a trap to the operating system, which will then handle the error, likely by terminating the program. Therefore, the statement that they 'cannot be attempted' is false."
  },

      "Privileged mode",
      "All of the above"
    ],
    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "Kernel mode is the privileged execution mode for the operating system and is also known as supervisor mode, system mode, and privileged mode. [cite: 3]"
  },
  {
    "question": "The two separate modes of operating in a system are",
    "options": [
      "Supervisor mode and system mode",
      "Kernel mode and privileged mode",
      "Physical mode and logical mode",
      "User mode and kernel mode"
    ],
    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "To protect the operating system from user applications, systems use a dual-mode operation consisting of user mode and kernel mode. [cite: 3]"
  },
  {
    "question": "The portion of the process scheduler in an operating system that dispatches processes is concerned with",
    "options": [
      "Assigning ready processes to CPU",
      "Assigning ready processes to the waiting queue",
      "Assigning running processes to blocked queue",
      "All of the mentioned"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "The dispatcher is the component that takes a process selected by the scheduler and assigns it to the CPU to run. [cite: 3]"

    "question": "The most common secondary storage device is",
    "options": [
      "Random-access memory",
      "Solid-state disks",
      "Tape drives",
      "Magnetic disk"

    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "Magnetic disks (Hard Disk Drives) are the most common form of secondary storage, used for non-volatile, high-capacity data storage. [cite: 5]"

  {
    "question": "A(n) ________ is the unit of work in a system.",
    "options": ["Process", "Operating System", "Timer", "Mode bit"],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "A process is a program in execution and is considered the basic unit of work managed by the operating system. [cite: 8, 10]"
  },
  {
    "question": "A ________ can be used to prevent a user program from never returning control to the operating system",
    "options": ["Portal", "Program Counter", "Firewall 2", "Timer"],
    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "An operating system uses a hardware timer to regain control from a user program. If the timer interrupt goes off, the OS takes back control, preventing a single program from monopolizing the system. [cite: 38, 46]"
  },
  {
    "question": "Mention True or false. In role-based access control, every user takes one or more roles, and based on the roles, each user is allowed to access the system resources.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "This statement accurately defines Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), where permissions are associated with roles, and users are assigned to roles. [cite: 129, 130, 131]"
  },
  {
    "question": "Mention True or false. Authorization deals with deciding who the user is, and the authentication deals with restricting what operations or data the user can access.",
    "options": ["True", "False"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "The statement is false because it has the definitions reversed. Authentication verifies who a user is, while authorization determines what a user is allowed to access. [cite: 134, 136, 137]"
  },
  {
    "question": "Initially what step has to be carried out to define access control?",
    "options": [
      "Accountability logging",
      "ACL verification",
      "Subject authorization",
      "Subject identification"
    ],
    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "The initial step for access control is subject identification, where a user or process claims an identity (e.g., provides a username). [cite: 142, 157, 158] This must happen before the system can authenticate and authorize the subject."
  },
  {
    "question": "An authentication factor which is a physiological or behavioural characteristic unique to a subject is called?",
    "options": ["Account ID", "Biometric factor", "Token", "IQ"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "This is the definition of a biometric factor, which uses unique physiological or behavioral traits for authentication. [cite: 160, 164, 165]"

  {
    "question": "Which one of the following access controls is defined based on the use of labels?",
    "options": ["Discretionary", "Mandatory", "Role-based", "Nondiscretionary"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is a security model that uses security labels on subjects and objects to enforce access policies. [cite: 174, 186]"

    "question": "In order to authenticate the users requesting to access the resources, which of the following technologies can be used for fingerprint scanning, iris scanning and retina scanning?",
    "options": [
      "Micrometrics",
      "Macrometrics",
      "Biometrics",
      "MicroBiometrics"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Biometrics is the technology that uses unique physiological characteristics like fingerprints, iris patterns, and retina scans to authenticate users. [cite: 175, 197]"
