    "options": ["$h=O(loglogn)$", "$h=O(nlogn)$", "$h=O(n)$", "$h=O(log~n)$"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "To find the height of a binary tree, you must traverse all the nodes to determine the longest path from the root to any leaf. This traversal takes time proportional to the number of nodes, $n$. Therefore, the time complexity is $O(n)$ in all cases (average, best, and worst)."

    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "In Oracle SQL, the `ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY` command is used to add or remove constraints like `NOT NULL` on an existing column. The data type often needs to be re-specified in the statement. [cite: 14]",

    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Standard FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is inherently insecure as it transmits credentials and data in plaintext. Secure alternatives are FTPS and SFTP. Therefore, the statement that it securely transfers files is false. [cite: 18]"

    "question": "Which of the following is an idempotent method in a stateless protocol like HTTP?",
    "options": ["PUT", "CONNECT", "POST", "EXIT"],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "In HTTP, an idempotent method is one where making multiple identical requests has the same effect as making a single request. `PUT` is idempotent because resending a `PUT` request will not change the outcome. `POST` is not idempotent. [cite: 18]"

    "explanation": "In elliptic curve cryptography over a finite field $F_p$, the inverse of a point $P=(x, y)$ is $-P=(x, -y \\pmod{p})$. Here, $p=17$, so $-P = (3, -9 \\pmod{17}) = (3, 8)$. [cite: 34]"

    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Triple DES with two keys (and also with three keys) uses an Encrypt-Decrypt-Encrypt (EDE) sequence. For two keys, the operation is $E_{K1}(D_{K2}(E_{K1}(P)))$. This EDE structure was chosen to provide backward compatibility with single DES. [cite: 34]"

    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "The standard Diffie-Hellman protocol does not authenticate the communicating parties. This makes it vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, where an attacker can establish separate secure sessions with each party and relay messages between them, while reading or altering them.
