    "question": "Find the incorrect statement(s) from the following: (i) A virtual function is allowed to be a static member. (ii) The virtual keyword decides the dynamic binding.",
    "options": [
      "(i) only",
      "(ii) only",
      "All are incorrect",
      "All are correct"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "Statement (i) is incorrect because static functions belong to a class, not an object, and cannot be overridden; virtual functions require an object to enable runtime polymorphism. Statement (ii) is correct, as the `virtual` keyword is the mechanism for enabling dynamic binding in C++."

      "There should be one catch block for one try block.",
      "There may be multiple catch blocks for a single try block.",
      "There may be a catch block without even a single try block.",
      "All are correct"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "A single `try` block can be followed by multiple `catch` blocks to handle various types of exceptions. A `catch` block, however, cannot exist without a preceding `try` block."

    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "The sequence is as follows: an error is encountered (Hit), the program creates and signals an exception (Throw), the runtime system finds a suitable block to manage the error (Catch), and the code within that block is executed (Handle)."
